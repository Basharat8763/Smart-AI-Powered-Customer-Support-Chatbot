# Smart-AI-Powered-Customer-Support-Chatbot
## Overview  
This project presents a **Smart AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot** designed to provide intelligent, automated, and real-time responses to customer queries.  
It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** integrated with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to understand user intent and deliver precise, context-aware answers.  

The chatbot enables small businesses to provide **24/7 support** without needing human agents, thereby improving response times, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

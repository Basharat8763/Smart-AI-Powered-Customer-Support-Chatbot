# Smart-AI-Powered-Customer-Support-Chatbot
This project aims to develop a web-based, AI-powered chatbot that automatically answers
customer queries using a companyâ€™s existing FAQ and help documents. It leverages Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and state-of-the-art Language Models (LLMs) to understand and
respond to questions in natural human language.
The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fetch relevant content from a
knowledge base (FAQ/help docs), which is then passed to the LLM for generating precise
responses. It is designed to be easy to deploy for small businesses via a web interface and does
not rely on third-party messaging platforms like WhatsApp.
